Triple-quoted strings are useful any time you need multiline text in your program; for
example, to embed multiline error messages or HTML or XML code in your source
code files. You can embed such blocks directly in your scripts without resorting to
external text files or explicit concatenation and newline characters.

Triple-quoted strings are also commonly used for documentation strings, which are
string literals that are taken as comments when they appear at specific points in your
file (more on these later in the book). These donâ€™t have to be triple-quoted blocks, but
they usually are to allow for multiline comments.
